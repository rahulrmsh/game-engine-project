# Gamma Engine

A game engine is a software development environment designed to build video games. Developers use game engines to make video games for consoles, mobile devices, and personal computers. The project aims to develop a game engine that is compact with industry-grade performance. This game engine will be a lightweight alternate that provides RTS path-finding with less expensive operations. The game engine will include a rendering engine, a physics engine, scripting support, animation support, networking support, memory management support, localization support, and scene graph visualization.
